# AQ Metrics Employment Challenge
This is my attempt to solve the challenge provided by AQ Metrics.  This application is built on Angular 1.6.4 and is designed to fetch a small number of alerts from an external souce and render them based on user requirements provided by the business.

## How to run the application
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the cloned directory using a terminal and type `npm start`.  All dependecies will be installed and a browser will automatically be launched displaying the application.
3. You can also execute `npm test` to exectue the application unit tests.
